How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    when we notice what changes happened we can see in the changed stuff th proplem will be there 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

   we can have the older versions of any file we are working at ,
   we can easiley compate between two versions 
   we can restore an older version
   we can compare to check out the bugs

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros 
        fewer commits are made
        more personal 
        more logical commits
        being able to control every aspect of my commit
    cons
        hard
        i could forget to commit
        afraid of loosing data
        less flexible in using
        it would be petter to have the option to use it or not


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    git
        was created to store codes and alot of times codes are connected to each others
        to give more options to control the commit
    google docs
        is made to save diffrent documents which most of the time is seprated
        being able to make a commit to single file at a time give the user more control
        multible tracking is very bad if we want to restore the historey of one file not the all repository
        we can have one file from a commit and another file from other commit

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log
        shows all the commits that have been made to the repository
        show the time commits has been done in
        show the person who made these commits 
        show the id of each commit 
        show the msg from each commit
    git diff
        show the diffrences between two commits
        if we put a commit and the commit just before it,, it can shows the changes that have been made to that exact commit.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    as i can change what i want and in the end if any bug has happened i can track it down even of o made alot of changes
    this give me more confidnce when i code 
    and make me less frustrated if a bug showed case i know that i will track it down
    

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    i want to use it in developing programs in c++
