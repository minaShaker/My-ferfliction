When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

        if i'm not on my laptop
        to make it possible to use diffrent devicies
        to make other people see my work and change it 
        in case of forking 
        if the file was large in size
        if there was no need to download it as the project is simple

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

        give more privacy for work
        give the ability to only push when my project redy
        if auto it could just push meaningles work

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks
        is to clone a repository on github to my repository on github
        without coping it or cloining it to my devices
        to have my own modificable c=version of the project 
    clones
        is to download a repository to my device to be able to change it
        if i wanted to modifiy it 
        if it is not allowed for me to modifie this repository
        if it's a project i'm included in and i should contrubute in
    branches
        it's to make a new line of commits on my project
        to have diffrent versions of my project
        to add feature or fix a bug
